# Conway's Game of Life
This is a quick react app I made that lets you mess around with Conway's game of life which simulates cellular automaton

## How it works
* Alive cells with <2 live neighbors die due to under population
* Alive cells with >3 live neighbors die due to overcrowding
* Alive cells with 2 or 3 live neighbors stay alive
* Dead cells with exactly 3 live neighbors are reborn

## How to use
* Select cells you want to be alive by clicking on them
* Iterate through generations by clicking the next button
* Reset to an empty board by clicking reset
